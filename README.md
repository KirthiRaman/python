EARLIER CORRECTION HERE BELOW IS INCORRECT (The duplicate values were only for start, not finish and energies)
I AM KEEPING THIS COMMENT TO FOLLOW MY PROGRESS ALONG:
---------------EARLIER COMMENT (NOT VALID ANYMORE------------------------------------------------------------
A CORRECTION:
  First I thought something was wrong with the sort program.  But looks like the data has some duplicates as shown below:
  (After being suspicious, I ran some quick program to see if those diplicates occur and where they occur)
  DATA DUPLICATES:
  
  {
   duplicate value 50402 50790 1164
   duplicate value 56932 57308 1504
   duplicate value 131327 131474 735

  NEW COMMENT:
  The algorithm for sorting the input (from both python and Java has been changed to make sure they work correctly)
  After that both python and Java have produced the same results.
  
  
  
Assignment by endgame recruiter
I am not going to write too much here - (So people could google search and copy the results)

Gave my first attempt with what ever I knew about python

I can optimize this - i have to know more about lists

NOTE:  IF ANYONE LOOKED AT THIS CODE BEFORE 9:30 AM (EST) THEN YOU WERE LOOKING AT A BUGGY WRONG VERSION OF THE CODE
      THIS ONE STILL MISSES THE LIST OF PATH IN THE RESULTS.  
      PLEASE LOOK AT THE results.txt FOR THE GIVEN INPUT

I checked the results several times, and figured that the sorted input through C program and python was giving wrong results. I just used Java to sort those input and created sorted_input.txt.

Using that sorted_input.txt, I could get the results (which is more accurate)
