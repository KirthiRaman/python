python
======

Assignment by endgame recruiter
I am not going to write too much here - (So people could google search and copy the results)

Did not have much time - so I did the sorting of paths done quickly in C
My first attempt was C and Java.  But python is good too

Spent time thinking about the algorithm - Will have to turn that into program

Will have to have List of lists - which will grow and shrink as we build the paths
Ultimately the final result could be just one optimal path (with low energy) OR maybe couple of paths
(Who knows)

Ultimately should look for destination of subpaths - if at some point in the list the desintation subpaths are identical
we can eliminate the one with higher energy consumed and so the list would shrink then.
